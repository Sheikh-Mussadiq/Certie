## 🔄 Migration Path

If you already used the old approach:
1. Delete existing products/prices from Stripe (if desired)
2. Clear services table: `DELETE FROM services;`
3. Run the new function for complete automation

The new function is **backward compatible** - it won't conflict with your existing setup.
